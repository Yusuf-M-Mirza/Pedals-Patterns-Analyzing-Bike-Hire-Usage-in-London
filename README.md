<h1>Pedals & Patterns: Analyzing Bike-Hire Usage in London</h1>

 ### [Bike-Hire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kalacheva/london-bike-share-usage-dataset)

<h2>Description</h2>
Within August 2023, there were 776,527 trips made with the Transport for London (TfL) Cycle Hire scheme. These trips were all recorded, with datapoints including: starting location, duration, ending location, as well as time-of-day. I hope to use exploratory data analysis techniques and translate raw data into actionable insights so as to improve the Cycle Hire service by TfL and boost the overall efficiency of public transport.
